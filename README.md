Answers to all Coursera financial aid questions

Q. Reason you applied for aid:
→ I am currently a student at PVG's College of Engineering and Technology, Pune, India, and I have a deep interest in Technology and Designing field. As the technology as well as designing field is a thriving industry in 2024, I feel I lack the fundamental knowledge of the field. As I want to get as much knowledge as I want to enter and work in the field of technology and design, basic knowledge is very much important. So I want to do a course that covers all the above topics and the information.
Being a student, I have no income stream of myself. I could have done internships and used the stipend to pay for this course, but currently, my college fees and expenses are already very much high. This leaves behind a very small amount of savings. 
As I have a deep interest in the field and the urge to learn something I love, I don't want to lose the opportunity to learn, just because I am unable to pay the amount. 
It is a great initiative by Coursera to have a 'Financial Aid' option, hence I would like to request a financial waiver for this course.

Q. How will taking this course help you achieve your career goals?
→ I have a solid background in the web technologies field, so I am eager to learn about User Experience and how to develop user friendly products which will make customer journey more easier. And that's the first step for me to make good projects that help people for an easy life and solve big problems. My main career goal is to learn every day, and I really want to learn and progress in my career. UX Design requires constant learning and improving, hence taking a course can help me advance in my knowledge.
I plan on gaining additional skills by taking related classes and continuing my involvement with variety of professional associations. I have noticed that there are a lot of companies that provide internships in the related field, and I would certainly be interested in taking that opportunities and improving myself to be one of the pioneers in the UX Design field.
There are many good opportunities available in this field that candidates can join, but one must have good knowledge to join these opportunities, so I am seeing this course with industry-standard tutorials and exercises as a boost to join me in the world's best companies. Courses on Coursera helped me to greatly increase my professional knowledge in the past, so learning about UX Design will help me explore wide opportunities in my career.
